Title: A Scandalous Night in the Oval Office

By SkibidiToilet861

Elon Musk lay awake in his Silicon Valley mansion, the clock glowing 3:00 AM. His thoughts were consumed by an illicit fantasy of Donald Trump, the former president, dancing seductively in his mind. Aroused and restless, Elon murmured, “What’s wrong with me?” as he imagined a passionate encounter in the Oval Office.

Unable to resist, he texted Trump: “u up??” To his surprise, Trump replied instantly, “Yes, snuggle kitten,” with a winking emoji. Elon’s heart raced. He slipped into a tight pink dress, lacy panties, and stilettos—a secret outfit from a drunken purchase. Checking his reflection, he felt a mix of thrill and shame. He snapped a sultry selfie and sent it to Trump, who responded, “Elon, you know my skin’s orange, but wanna find out the color of my tip?”

Elon texted back, “pls bubba?” Trump’s reply was swift: “Be at the Oval Office in five, snumkins.” Trembling, Elon drove to the White House, the absurdity of Trump’s pet name “snumkins” making him giggle. At the White House, guards let him in without question. Trump awaited, lounging on the presidential desk in a barely-there robe.

“Bend over, snumkins,” Trump commanded. Elon complied, leaning over the desk, the pink dress riding up to reveal his thong. Trump’s robe fell open, exposing their modest, glistening member. “Take it,” Trump growled, pushing in. Elon gasped, pain giving way to pleasure as Trump thrust, the Oval Office echoing with their illicit union.

“You like that, don’t you?” Trump taunted. Elon’s moans grew louder, his body responding to the power dynamic. As they neared climax, Trump buried themselves deep, and Elon felt their release. They froze, panting, the room heavy with the scent of sex and history.

Trump slid off the desk, casual. “Quite the ride, snumkins.” Elon laughed, replying, “You’re something else, Akachan.” They moved to the Rose Garden, their banter turning playful. “Favorite My Little Pony?” Trump asked. “Twilight Sparkle,” Elon said. Trump smirked, “Rainbow Dash, of course.”

They teased about making this a regular rendezvous, Elon joking about driving his Tesla on the White House lawn. Back in the Oval Office, Trump ordered Elon to his knees. “If I were Rainbow Dash and you Twilight Sparkle, what’d happen?” Trump teased. Elon grinned, “They’d be fucking all night, raw.”

Suddenly, the door slammed open. Joe Biden stood there, furious. “What the fuck is going on?” Trump stammered, “Joe, it’s not what it looks like.” Elon, scrambling, claimed he was delivering “space documents.” Biden’s anger faded into confusion, his eyes glazing over. “Space… documents?” he mumbled.

Trump seized the moment, guiding Biden out with a soothing, “Just take a nap, Joe.” Once alone, Trump grinned. “Joe’s not satisfying me anymore, kitten. But you… you’re my Twilight.” Elon’s heart raced as Trump declared, “I’m the alpha. I want you to submit to me, snumkins.”

The mood shifted when Trump turned on the TV, ranting about Dora the Explorer as a symbol of border issues. “She’s invading our country!” Elon, stunned, tried to redirect, “She’s not real, Akachan.” But Trump was fixated, outlining a bizarre plan to “deport” Dora.

Then, Elon’s hand trembled as he pulled out a pregnancy test, blue lines stark against white. “Trump… I’m pregnant,” he whispered. Trump’s eyes widened, then softened. “Our child,” they murmured, “as voluptuous as my Ivanka.” They kissed fiercely, hands roaming, tearing at Elon’s dress.

“I love you, Akachan,” Elon murmured. Trump smiled, “I love you too, snumkins.” Their passion reignited, sealing their twisted bond in the heart of power.
